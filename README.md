🚀 Embracing AI Agents in Development
I am excited to share my recent work on developing intelligent agents using Python! This project leverages advanced technologies to streamline tasks and enhance user interactions.

🔍 Use Case Overview
Purpose: To create an interactive agent that can assist users by responding to their queries and providing support in real-time.
Integration: The agent utilizes the Gemini API and OpenAI models to generate responses and manage conversations.
🔧 Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for developing the agent.
Agents Library: Importing necessary classes such as Runner, Agent, and OpenAIChatCompletionsModel to build the agent's functionality.
AsyncIO: Implementing asynchronous operations to handle multiple requests efficiently.
dotenv: Managing environment variables securely for API keys and configuration settings.
